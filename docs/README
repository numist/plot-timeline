Please see the README.php document, as this document is deprecated.

Some folks learn better from looking at code in the wild, instead of reading
docs.  I understand, it's the same with me.  Why don't you look at the tests/
directory, and run driver.php or functest.php from there to see how the whole
thing works, instead of reading these stupid docs?  (make sure your CWD is
tests when you run them)
